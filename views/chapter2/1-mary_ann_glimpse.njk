<h4>Harriett Street, Stockport</h4>

<p>We were very lucky that Father Denis Byrne and his assistants recorded an address for Bridget Caffrey, Bridget O’Neill’s marriage witness. 
As Harriet Street was in Stockport, it gave me somewhere to look for the bride on 30 March 1851, census day, less than six months before her 
wedding. And there I readily found her, lodging at no. 6.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:-5px;">Bridget’s fellow-lodger, Bridget Making, was roughly her age and in the same trade. The bride's marriage
	witness was recorded as a Bridget Caffrey of Harriet Street. We could find no Bridget Caffrey at all in the 1851 census of Harriet St or anywhere 
	nearby, so maybe the witness was Bridget Making, and there was some kind of error in recording or transcribing the wedding records. Or maybe Ms  
	Making married a Mr Caffrey between March and September, although we can find no evidence of this.</p>
	
    <p>I had been hoping that the identities and histories of Bridget O’Neill's fellow-lodgers or wedding witness might throw up some evidence or clue 
	as to her origins in Ireland. But no, at least not so far. The ages given in the four censuses from 1851-1881 are 23, 36, 44 and 50, placing 
	her birth year anywhere between 1824 and 1831. It is entirely possible that she didn’t know her own year of birth, in the form of a number. Her 
	surname is one of the very many available variant English spellings of O’Neill, which itself is surely a translation from Gaelic. In what follows, 
	I’ve mostly used the spellings as found in the original documents – the variations only occasionally give pause for doubt. But - from the 
	marriage record - we know Bridget’s parents’ Christian names were John and Sarah (and that, in September 1951, she believed them to be dead). 
	Also, it is difficult to see why her birthplace should be explicitly specified as County Dublin in the 1871 census if that was not true, whatever 
	might have been recorded at the other censuses.</p>
	
	<h4>Balbriggan, County Dublin</h4>
	
	<p>The digitised transcriptions of the hundreds of years of Catholic parish baptisms in Ireland inevitably fall well short of capturing every 
	baptism, and are sure to be inaccurate in places, if only because of the multiple difficulties of interpretation of age-old handwritten scripts. 
	But if you search for the baptism of a Bridget born to a John and Sarah in County Dublin between 1821 and 1831, there are only five results of 
	which one is a Bridget Neil. This baptism took place on 6 March 1825 in Balbriggan, a small seaside town (and Parish, and Townland) about 20 
	miles north of Dublin. Her parents were John Neil and Sarah Halpenny. Whilst there is no proof that this is the Bridget O’Neill who married 
	John Noonan in Salford in 1851, I think the probability looks pretty high. In this case, we have both a <span

	<p>I have also identified John O'Neill's and Sarah Halpenny's marriage in Balbriggan, which oddly took place after Bridget's baptism, on 28 August 1825.
	From my Irish searches, it is surprising that we don't find the standard abbreviation for the Latin<span style="font-family: Georgia;  
	color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i> "Filia Illegitima"</i></b></span> scrawled heavily by the priest in the baptism book. But no, the policy in 
	Balbriggan seems to have been more tolerant - perhaps he simply said kindly to the young couple "<i>come back to get married just as soon as 
	you have saved up the fee</i>". Here is the

	 <p>Happily there was a <span style="font-family: Georgia; color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i> "Filium Legitimum"</i></b></span> to follow some time
	after John and Sarah married, in the form of Francis O'Neill, Bridget's younger brother, who was baptised on 10 September 1826. Here is the

		his life, perhaps even in England if he migrated there too, and thus provide some supporting evidence that we have the correct Bridget 
		O'Neill. But no luck so far, as Francis simply disappears - he may not even have survived infancy.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:0;">Unfortunately, John and Sara's marriage record provides no information on parentage, and I cannot trace Sara Halpenny’s 
	birth or baptism, despite searching the whole British Isles, and despite the fact that there seems to have been at least 
	one generation of Halfpennys going back from 1825 in Balbriggan. But if we search for births/baptisms of John O'Neills focusing solely on 
	Balbriggan, the only candidate of a suitable age is the child of Felix O’Neill and Rose Rann, who was baptised on 20 December 1805. 
	They had been married (<span

		4 February 1799 (witnesses Patrick Rann and Hugh Connell), and had Elenor in 1800, Patrick in 1802, John in 1805 (<span

		finally another Felix in 1807. This is the furthest back we’ve reached, and is all based on the assumptions that the Balbriggan Bridget 
		O’Neil is the correct one, and that her father was also born there.</p>
	
	<p>This has allowed us to construct a small and tentative family diagram for Bridget O'Neill. It doesn't mean much by itself, but it might
	justify a research trip to Balbriggan. Heaven knows how much or how little might be discoverable - it
	is difficult to imagine that a trace might remain of a young woman who emigrated before 1851, probably in the midst of the 1846-1850 chaos.</p>
	<br>

	<p style="margin-top:0;">But there are some faint trails of circumstantial evidence. In the 1846 trade directory for Balbriggan, a John O'Neill had a carpentry
	business on Hampton Street. There was no similar listing in 1848. Balbriggan was quite big on cotton weaving, and associated textile
    industries, I think both mechanised and traditional. It was a place where Bridget O'Neill could have learned the skills on which she relied
    in Stockport. It was a port town, and Liverpool was the main overseas destination for its merchant ships. So Bridget could easily have
    arranged passage to Liverpool. But it was also linked by railway to nearby Dublin, offering an alternative route.</p>
	
	<p>For various reasons,the Fingal area (containing Balbriggan) was hard hit by the 1846-1850 crisis. The crop failure in 1846 was total.
	One the major Dublin workhouses was located at nearby Balrothery, and these places became centres of disease. The local powers enforced the
    cruel and perverse decrees from London strictly. Many local smallholders lost their properties entirely, as larger landowners took advantage
	of the opportunity to expand and consolidate. There were epidemics of typhoid in 1846 and cholera in 1849. The smallholding farming industry 
	must have collapsed completely, with severe knock-on effects on local small businesses. It would be all too easy to succumb to any of these
    threats, and if young Bridget lost her parents in their forties in the midst of all this, it would not be at all surprising. Perhaps
	they gave her their last cash towards her travels.</p>

    <p>But where did John Noonan come into all this? Once he was settled in Pendleton and she in Stockport, they would be unlikely to meet. And
	how and why did she head for Stockport and he for Salford? My theory is that they met during the escape journey. It is just possible that
	he travelled through Balbriggan to avoid the worst that Dublin City could throw at him (which would have been very bad). Or she travelled
	via Dublin and they met there. More likely, I think, is that they met in Liverpool, by which time he had some kind of destination point
	in Salford and she in Stockport. So they each stuck to their individual plan, but agreed to wed as soon as they could.</p>

	<p>All that can be said of this flight of fancy, though, is that to me it is the most plausibly consistent with the few known facts! But on
	reflection, John and Bridget's marriage certificate might (just possibly) show the places of residence and/or occupations of the fathers of
	the happy couple which could (just possibly) establish some link to Balbriggan, at least. Perhaps it should be added to the shopping list.</p><h4>A Glimpse of Mary Ann</h4>
