<h4>Joseph not a Burgin? The Donohoes and the Murphys</h4>
<p>There is a pretty reliable sighting of Joseph Burgin in 1881, when the 
<span class = "span-link"
        title = "view original census return"
        onclick = "viewImage('images/Joseph Bergan 1881 census extract manchester.jpg');">census return</span>
    shows him lodging at 1 Buckingham Street in Manchester. I am very confident that this is the same Joseph Burgin that we see thirty
    years later in the 1911 census married to Rose Ann. His implied year of birth is identical, his occupation is identical (the very
    specialised calenderer, or cloth finisher), and his place of birth is identical. Remarkably, there is only a single letter difference
    in the spelling of the surname, for which I have seen upwards of five different variants. Some believe the name is derived
    from the French Bourgogne - would this involve the dukes of Burgundy, I ask, and could they have somehow been associated with the
    Normans? The story goes that in Ireland, their mixed descendants morphed (maybe with an intermediate Gaelic phase) into Bergans, Burgons,
    etc etc etc, whilst in England, the spelling stayed closer to the original French, such as Burgoyne. But I digress.</p>

<p>Joseph is also readily identified at the 1871 census, this time with some parents present. I don't know whether 2 April 1871 was
    a typical evening in that household, but the large number and varied mix of people present is interesting enough for me to reproduce
    all that was recorded.</p>

<p>Once again, there can be hardly any doubt that this is the correct Joseph Burgin. There is a one year 
difference in
    year of birth, but the name is spot on, as is the place of birth. His father's occupation is closely related to the one he 
	will take up later. As for his own occupation, he might have been assisting a chicken-rearer and vendor - that is the 
	only dictionary definition I can find for "poulterer". But note that there are two young men present in the household
	that day with that occupation, plus two dyers, and think of the word "poultice" and its connotations. I
    wouldn't be at all surprised if poultering was a process in the cloth production industry of the time.</p>

<p>However, there is another fly in the ointment, as there seems to be a discrepancy around Joseph's father's name - are 
    these really his parents? Comparing with Joseph and Rose Ann's marriage record, Fanton had somehow to become Francis. 
	More accurately, in the Latin used for the marriage record, Fanton and Eliza became Francisci and Elisabethae. 
	I suspect either that Joseph became embarrassed and confused over his father's unusual name, or that the priest 
	(who I think was probably Dutch or Belgian, and maybe recently arrived in Salford) became exasperated
	trying to translate it (or both). Fenton is occasionally used as a given name, but mostly in England. Fanton is so 
	unusual that it sounds like a familiar contraction of Frank Anthony, or something like that.  Nevertheless I have 
	a strong feeling that this is the correct couple. My sister Fran later discovered that Fintan is a "bona fide" 
	Irish Christian name, derived from the Gaelic, and - as generally required - associated with an officially sanctified 
	saint (those very early monastic types who converted the Irish long before the official "Roman" church
	reached them). "Fenton" wouldn't be a bad stab at a transcription for an English census enumerator who, like me, had 
	never heard the name Fintan before.</p>

<p>Looking at the 1871 census return, the natural conclusion to draw would be that Fanton and Eliza arrived in England from 
Ireland (separately or together) prior to the
    mid-1850s, and went on to produce Joseph. But we would need to keep an open mind on whether they married in Ireland or 
	in England, and on whether Joseph had any siblings. Either way, we would expect to find the family present in England - 
	probably in the Manchester area - at the 1861 census. But we find that there is no sign whatsoever of a Fanton Burgin 
	- or anyone close - at the 1861 census.</p>

<h6>Fanton and Eliza married in 1865</h6>
<p>It struck me that it was slightly unusual to find a married couple in their fifties and sixties living with a 16-year-old
son but with no sign of any other siblings. It crossed my mind that maybe Fanton and Eliza had married slightly late in life. 
But I was amazed when I discovered how late their marriage seems to have been. There is a civil record of a marriage between 
a Fenton Bergen and an Eliza Donoghoe in the fourth quarter of 1865 in the Chorlton registration district (the southern 
edge of central Manchester to you and me). With the name combination of Fanton, Burgin and Eliza, plus the location, it 
seems to me incredibly unlikely that this was a different couple from that we found six years later at the 1871 census. 
If it was the same couple, they would have been 54 and 46 years
old at the time of their marriage, and Joseph, who must therefore have been born into a prior relationship, would have been
10. The next two questions would then be whether Donoghoe was a married or a maiden name, and whether Joseph had
been born a Donohue. So far, we had been unable to locate any record of the birth of Joseph Burgin in the 1850s in 
Lancashire, but perhaps now we had the key to this riddle.</p>

<h6>Joseph born a Donoghoe in 1854?</h6>
<p>Sure enough, there was a civil record of the birth of a Joseph Donohoe, registered in Manchester in the 
	fourth quarter of 1854, mother's maiden name Murphy (but at this stage no record of her forename, as the 
	basic civil birth records supply child's forename and both parents' unmarried names, at best). 
	So it then looked very much as if Joseph Burgin was in fact born Joseph Donohoe, son of some Mr
	Donohoe and (as it then appeared) an Eliza Murphy, and took on the name Burgin after losing his dad and then gaining a 
	step-dad (Fenton Burgin) in 1865. Joseph was by then ten or eleven years old, so would have been aware that 
	he was a Donoghoe, but acquiring a new step-father. The year of this birth record is close enough to those 
	implied by the 1871, 1881 and 1911 census returns to be entirely credible for Joseph Burgin, calenderer. 
	So it seemed as if we had our Joseph and his mother, and also that there were
	no blood ties to the Bergons.</p>
	
<p> Much later we obtained a copy of Joseph Donohoe's birth certificate, and
		this threw a huge spanner into the moving parts of the analysis I'm describing here. But for the time being,
		let's proceed as we did before we'd seen this certificate.</p>

<p>After identifying Joseph Donohoe's basic birth details (excluding mother's forename), the next obvious steps were to find 
a record of his parents' marriage, establish the full identity of his blood-father, and then find the Donoghoe family 
in the 1861 census. Of course, this simple-sounding plan conveniently side-steps a built-in 
	problem which underlies the whole of this narrative, as it cannot convey the thoroughness - or otherwise - 
	with which searches for events that have never been found were undertaken. I've used wild-cards, variant spellings, 
	adjustments of the search time windows and variation of search areas (such as switching between Salford and 
	Manchester, expanding to the whole of Lancashire - and occasionally to England, or Ireland). But if the event
	being sought never happened, or wasn't recorded, or if the record is lost, or was never digitised, the degree 
	of "search-diligence" is hardly relevant.</p>

<p>In the current instance, my first failure had been to find a birth of a Joseph Burgin in or near Manchester between 
1850 and 1860. Next there had been no sign at all of any marriage between a Fanton Burgin and any Eliza prior to that birth, 
including Irish marriages. To add to this tally, it turned out now that I could not find any marriage between an Eliza and 
a Donohoe in England in the decade prior to 1855. But I did find one in Ireland.</p>

<h6>1853 marriage of a John Donohoe and an Eliza Murphy, Dublin</h6>
<p>A John Donohoe was married to an Eliza Murphy in St Nicholas (Without), Francis Street, Dublin on 12 January 1853.
    The witnesses were a Daniele Kavanagh and a Catharina King, these being the only clues - unusable so far - that 
	the record gives as to the bride and groom's origins. No details of either set of parents was recorded.</p>
	
	<p>I would (perhaps naively) expect a Murphy to have a background in Cork, or at least Munster, but that could have 
	been generations back. If we have the right Eliza here, she would have been about 34 in 1853 (from the Manchester 
	1871 census return), which is quite late for a typical marriage in the catholic community in the Ireland of those times. 
	I wonder whether she had already been widowed, in which case Murphy might have been a married, not a maiden name 
	(and there may have been no link to Cork at all). The numbers of second marriages must have increased in the
	aftermath of the famine, as the number of premature deaths of spouses increased. At this point, there seems 
	little likelihood of tracing either of these two individuals back further given the paucity of information on them.</p>

<p> My imagination baulks when I think of what the conditions in Dublin must have been in the early 1850s - there had 
    been hundreds of thousands of deaths, the countryside was still emptying into the cities, and the cities were 
	emptying to the rest of the world. Dublin would have been full of desperate people, many of them hoping to be 
	"just passing through". It is possible that John and Eliza married with the explicit plan of "getting out of there" 
	together.</p>

<p>And - assuming that this <b>is</b> the couple we are looking for - get out they did. By the fourth quarter of 1854, 
the birth of a Joseph Donohgue (MMN Murphy) was being registered with the local authorities in Manchester, England.</p>

<p> If we were still on the right track, we would hope that John & Eliza Donohoe would have been able to settle in the 
	Manchester area and perhaps grow their family, in which case we should be able to find their household in the 1861 
	E&W census.</p>

	<p>But no - from what we already know, John Donoghoe must have died by 1865, when Eliza married Fanton. What we 
	don't know is whether he died before or after the 1861 census, and whether they had had any more children by then. 
	The fact that Eliza brought only one child into her marriage with Fanton suggests there were no more children who 
	survived, at least. And as we think she was about age 35 when she had Joseph, it wouldn't be surprising if he 
	was her last.</p>

<p>We have no idea of the date of birth of Joseph Burgin/Donohue's father, except that in 1853, his age must have 
fallen within an "acceptable range" for marrying a woman of about 34. This compounds the difficulty of identifying 
  the record of his death. But there are numerous "candidates" for his death in the civil records for the 
  Manchester area from 1855 to 1865, so I think we simply have to accept that one of these is our John's death.
  Which leaves us with the 1861 census - we simply cannot find a family headed by a John Donoghoe and including 
  an Eliza and a Joseph both of the right age. Nor can we find John living with either one of them separately.</p>
  
<p>I did eventually find another 1861 record of a Joseph Donohoe in the "target area", but any connection was
somewhat dubious, even before we obtained the 1854 birth certificate of Joseph Donohoe, MMN Murphy. The 1861
record was, sadly, of two inmates of Salford workhouse. I no longer have any strong idea of whether or not it
rightly belongs in our story, but I have kept it here because it might just be relevant and it is also interesting
in its own right.</p>

<p class="mb-0">Here are two J Donohoes, a widow aged 28 together with her seven year-old son. On census day, 7

</ul>


<p>I don't know whether poor old Eliza and Joseph, who would be my great-great-grandmother and great-grandfather, really 
	did have to suffer the workhouse experience or not. I've simply set out what we've discovered so far. But before I
	move on, here is a little flavour from the <span class = "span-link"
                                    title = "view documents"
                                    onclick = "viewImage('images/SUWH2-5.jpg');">header pages of the 
									institutional return</span>,
    run by the surely redoubtable couple Thomas and Hannah Bebbington (for those who have any general interest in the workhouse). 
	Incidentally, this was the institution on Regent Road, a
    little south of the cattle market, and not far from where Elizabeth Corcoran would later live prior to her marriage in 1880,
    or from where James and Hannah Noonan lived in early 1901.</p>
	
<p> But now I need (at last) to turn to the effect which obtaining Joseph Donohoe's <span class = "span-link"
        title = "view certificate"
        onclick = "viewImage('images/Joseph_Donohoe Birth_Cert 1854.jpg');">full birth certificate </span> had on our detective
work up to that point. A Joseph Donohoe was born on 26 November 1854 at No.1 Passage Gregson St Manchester (just off Deansgate
towards the Knott Mill end). His parents were John (a shoemaker) and <b><i>Margaret</i></b>, nee Murphy (that is NOT <b><i>
Eliza</i></b>, nee Murphy). Margaret registered the birth on 12 December 1854, and signed with a mark because she couldn't 
write her name. Unless Margaret was one of those people who switch around their forenames radically during their lives, 
this could not be the Eliza Murphy who married a John Donohoe in Dublin on 12 January 1853, nor the Eliza Donohoe who 
later married Fanton Burgin in Manchester during 1865. The effect on our analysis so far was pretty devastating.</p>

<p>And it got worse. I found John and Margaret Donohoe in the 1861 census, at exactly the same address and in the same
occupation as when Joseph was born. At that point, they had four children living with them, but none of them
was called Joseph. The Joseph born to them in late 1854 should have passed his sixth birthday by then. Possibly he
was with a relative on census day, but more likely he had died in infancy. The death records include enough Joseph 
Donohoes in the right area and time period to make this plausible, but none of the records include the age at death.</p>

<p>Here is the <span class = "span-link"
        title = "view census return"
        onclick = "viewImage('images/Donohoe shoemakers 1861.jpg');">census record for John & Margaret's 
		family in early April 1861</span>. The first three children had been born in Ireland,
		and the last, Mary Ann, had been born in Manchester around 1851. Whatever happened to Joseph, this 
		absolutely cannot be the couple who married in Dublin in 1853. And even if it somehow was, whatever must
		have happened to their other children in the four years before Eliza Donohoe married Fanton Burgin 
		in 1865? That marriage certificate remains on our shopping list. So far, I've not identified any
		members of the 1861 census household in the 1871 or later censuses, whether separately or together.  Nor
		have I yet been able to find any record of their marriage in Ireland or their children's births.</p>
		
<p> So. We can stand by the marriage of Eliza Donohoe and Fanton Burgin in 1865. And we can stand by that of Eliza
Murphy and John Donohoe in 1853. The elephant in the room is the total lack of a credible birth of a Joseph Donohoe
around 1855. We must suppose that about the same time that John and Margaret Donohoe (nee Murphy) were producing a 
Joseph Donohue, another John Donohoe was also busy producing another Joseph, with his wife Eliza (also nee Murphy). 
Although this may seem improbable, when you think of the propensity for people to marry someone related to their
in-laws, it could just hang together. Other than that, all we can say is there's a whole bunch of loose ends hanging
here and good luck to anyone else who tries to resolve them.</p>

<p>Before we turn to the Dolans, there are a couple of further loose ends to consider - I don't say tie up, as 
we've rarely been able to
    form any kind of finished knot at the end of any string. What became of Fanton and Eliza Burgin after 1871? Whilst not proven, it
    looks very much as if Eliza died in the third quarter of 1873. The age given was 47, which would have her born around 1826, rather than
    around 1819 as implied by the 1871 census. But death records have proved to be notoriously inaccurate as to age. No other deaths
    in Manchester, Salford or nearby from 1871 to 1911 look at all like hers.</p>
	
<p>If that is correct, Eliza's marriage to Fanton - and Joseph's experience as a stepson - lasted only eight years. It looks as if Fanton
    was about 55 when he married Eliza, and it might be difficult even for the most child-friendly of men to form a good relationship with
    a ten year-old at that age. I do think Fanton helped Joseph find a trade, however, and it looks as if he relied on it for the rest of his
    life. But Joseph would have been about nineteen when his mother died, and he probably couldn't wait to flee the nest. Especially if he
    regularly had to compete for attention with a miscellany of around ten other visitors, lodgers and miscellaneous!</p>

<p>As for Fanton himself, it appears that he found some people to care for him during at least part of his latter years, these being 
	"The Little Sisters of the Poor" in their "Home for Aged People" on Culcheth Lane in Newton Heath. I wonder whether Joseph 
	ever visited him there. This institution was still marked on street-maps in the 1930s, and was very close to where Peter Reid
	began his industrial career in Manchester, and to Failsworth, where James and Elizabeth Cassidy moved together with Margaret 
	Corcoran after their marriage in 1880. Our promising candidate appears with other elderly inmates on the relevant 
	<span class = "span-link" 
		  title = "view census page" 
		  onclick = "viewImage('images/Fenton Bargan 1881 old peoples home.jpg');">
		  page of the 1881 census return</span>.</p>

<p> After 1881, Fanton seems to evaporate from the records entirely. Not only does he fail to appear in any subsequent censuses 
   (quite reasonable for a 73 year-old), but he also shows no sign of having died, ever or anywhere (rather more spooky). 
   In the 1930s, All Saints cemetery was just around the corner from the Home for the Aged on Culcheth Lane. I wonder if it 
   is still there, and contains any memorial of Fanton Burgin.</p>

<p>In the event, it has turned out that the Burgin branch has been the hardest of all the branches to trace back. This section 
	reflects some really last minute progress, but it remains too tentative for my liking, as we have so far not found any of 
	those tiny, but so valuable, links between the beginning and end of the chain of descent. But hope springs eternal, and 
	never having been able to resist clutching at any visible straw, I noticed that two of the godparents of Joseph and Rose 
	Ann's children were named Murphy, just as Eliza had been many years before. Could they be related somehow? This led me on 
	to what I must call "<a href="dig3b" title = "Take the digression">The Bangladesh Digression</a>". And although I didn't 
	prove there was a family link, I didn't prove there wasn't either.</p>
