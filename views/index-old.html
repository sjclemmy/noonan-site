      <p>I think dad is big enough to forgive me, even from his grave, for laying a goodly portion of the blame for the Nottingham digression at his door.
         Quite understandably, it was his belief/assumption that Mary Foster (whom he knew only as Wynne) must be a child of Rose Ann Burgin's from
         a relationship prior to her marriage to Joseph. So it was such a relationship that we searched for. We had the advantage that we knew Mary's maiden
         name from her marriage record. So we were looking for a marriage between Rose Ann Dolan and a Mr Foster, probably in the mid to late-1880s. At
         that point, we only had the vaguest knowledge of Mary Foster's birth. The births of two Mary Fosters were registered in Salford in the first
         quarter of 1889, one with maiden name given as Foster, and the other as Dolman. This was quite disconcerting, especially when we discovered
         that the second Mary's grandma was called Rose Ann Dolman. This looked so like a typo, even if it implied some really convoluted set of relationships.
         But the Dolmans turned out to be a coal-mining family originating in Staffordshire.</p>

      <p>Back to the search for marriages. If Rose Ann had somehow supplied her married name in place of her maiden name when she registered the birth,
         well, what of it? The searchable national database for births does not supply forenames for either the mother or the father, so we assumed it
         was Rose Ann (married name Foster) who had registered the birth. Nothing so far contradicted dad's assumption. So we searched Salford for marriages
         between a Rose Ann Dolan and a Foster betwen 1881 (when Rose Ann was a single lodger) and 1889. Then we searched Manchester. Then we extended to
         Lancashire, and finally to England as a whole. Bingo!</p>
      <br>
      <img src = "rose dolan samuel foster marriage notts 1885.jpg"

      <p style="margin-top:0;">This was great, but what on earth was Rose Ann doing in Nottingham? She was Catholic, but this was an Anglican marriage.
         She'd have had to fall seriously in love to be prepared to bridge that divide. I could not imagine that Rose Ann would have gone to Nottingham alone,
         so she must have met Samuel Foster in Salford and they must have travelled together. This was strange in my recent research experience -
         in fact it was strange for anyone to ever leave Salford - so all the more interesting and exciting. My next task was to locate this Samuel Foster in
         Salford. It would be helpful if he had a good, readily transferable, trade.</p>

      <p>Samuel Foster wasn't hard to find in Salford at the 1881 census. He was 19 years old at the time, a Salfordian stonemason, first child of Elizabeth
         and Samuel, a pavior (or paver in modern terms). Almost the same age as Rose Ann, a good trade which could support him anywhere, the only problem
         was, wrong religion.</p>

      <p>But the pieces of the jigsaw were falling into place - obviously there would have been religious, quite probably added to racial, prejudice from
         at least one of the families.</p>
      <br>
      <img src = "samuel foster household salford 1881.jpg"

      <p style="margin-top:0;">It was increasingly clear that we were looking at an old-fashioned elopement, just like in the movies. They ran off to Nottingham
         together and got hitched. Don't ask why Nottingham, there must have been some tenuous connection. The next thing to do was to check on the children
         they produced. But there was n sign of any children in Nottingham, which was a little disconcerting. By this time, I was harbouring images of a
         strong young stonemason, perhaps working on the steeples of the local churches, with a healthy young family on the verge of being created. But
         something seemed wrong.</p>

      <p>Of course, throughout the whole of this analysis, we had been keeping on the back-burner the fact that Mary was born in Salford, not Nottingham. But
         surely some answer to this conundrum would present itself at some stage - and so it did. We found a record of the death of a Samuel Foster in Nottingham
         in the first quarter of 1888, age exactly right - I had a terrible image of the poor young man toppling from his scaffolding - and of course he could have left Rose Ann
         pregnant.</p>

      <p>The timing would be fine - Mary Foster would be born in the fourth quarter of 1888 (and so she was), and her birth would be
         registered early in 1889. And what could Rose Ann have done after her husband's death except return to the Salford where she had been raised
         to have her baby?</p>
      <br>
      <img src = "samuel foster household salford 1891.jpg"
           style ="width: 600px; border: 2px solid sienna;float: left;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-right:20px;"

           onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen69', 1, 5, 2, 3339, 2194, 'samuel foster household salford 1891.jpg');">
      <p style="margin-top:0;">It must have been pretty rough for Rose Ann after her return to Salford, as she would have had hardly anyone to turn to. There
         was her younger brother Thomas who may have helped, although there was no visible evidence of this. She could have gone back to the Foster family,
         although if there had been an elopement, they might well be unforgiving. I checked their status at the 1891 census. You can see that Samuel (junior)
         is no longer present, as we would expect. But nor is there any sign of a young widow Rose Ann or a grandaughter Mary. As expected, they had rejected
         her and the child.</p>

      <p>So now we had our story and the explanation of Mary Foster's identity. Rose Ann was the widow of Samuel Foster when she married Joseph Burgin
         in 1892, and she took Mary Foster with her into the marriage. So Mary would have been Catherine Burgin's elder step-sister all along, as dad had assumed.
         Until, that is, we had occasion to pass through Nottingham on entirely different business, giving us an opportunity to drop into the office of the
         Nottinghamshire County Archives (where many of the old church marriage records are held).</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0;">At the expense of 45 minutes of searching, assisted by the very helpful staff, and 20p for the photocopier, we were
         able to obtain a copy of the full record of the marriage of Rose Dolan and Samuel Foster on 4 April 1885 at St Matthias Church in the (now) suburb
         of Sneinton. And then, as on the road to Damascus many years ago, the scales fell from my eyes. No one fell in love with an Anglican stonemason, and
         no one eloped. No one fell from a steeple scaffold leaving a pregnant widow, and the pavior Samuel Foster was not guilty of rejecting his own
         grandaughter out of religious or any other kind of prejudice. I had got the story utterly - or perhaps almost utterly - wrong.</p>

      <p>Samuel (a threader and winder) was the son of William (a hose trimmer). Rose (a cleaner in hosiery) was the daughter of
         Bernard (a labourer). They were local people and had nothing to do with the families in which we were interested.
         To the amateur genealogist, the message is straightforward: even if it looks exactly like what you're looking for, it probably isn't!</p>

      <p>All this took place before we obtained Mary Foster's full birth certificate, which confirmed what we by then suspected, namely that her mother
         was not Rose Ann at all - it turned out to be Ellen Foster. We now assume, perhaps wrongly, that Mary was born out of wedlock, if only because Ellen
         failed to provide the father's name. But I'm slowly learning to keep my mind enormously open. The most focused of my readers (if any) will have
         noticed that Samuel Foster (junior) was not the only family member to disappear from his father's household between the 1881 and 1891 censuses.
         His younger sister Ellen also disappeared. We have searched high and low for Mary Foster's mother, and we have an ill-defined shortlist of
         possible candidates picked from the 1881 census records of Salford. By pure coincidence, I think, Samuel's younger sister Ellen is on that list.
         But so far there is no evidence to take investigations further.</p>

      <p>We did a drive-by of St Matthias while we were in Nottingham. Happily, it is still a church, but now a major headquarters of the Coptic Christian
         church of Egypt within the UK, so important that the patriarch himself came all the way from Egypt to open it a few years ago. As one of the
         oldest branches of christianity, that is something that Sneinton and Nottingham can be proud of.</p>

      <p>Catherine Burgin's godmother at her baptism in 1892 was a Mary Murphy, no address given. Seven years later in 1899, her brother Joseph's godmother
         was a Sara Murphy, again with no address. But they might have come from the same family, they could even be sisters. Murphy is the oldest family name
         by which we know Joseph Burgin's mother, Eliza, and may well have been her maiden name. I couldn't resist giving at least a shot at finding a family
         relationship. So I did the obvious thing and searched for a family of Murphys within reach of St John the Evangelist in Salford, and including a
         Mary and a Sara, each old enough to play the required godmother role at the required time.</p>

      <p>This produced two candidate families. The first was headed by Patrick Murphy with his wife Mary, and there was a daughter Sarah. Either of these
         women could have been a godmother, although Mary obviously was not a Murphy by birth. But there were two problems with this candidate. First,
         Patrick was too young to have been Eliza's brother (although there could of course been a different relationship). The second is more practical:
         Patrick and his wife left no indication in any of the three E&W censuses in which they participated of which part of Ireland they came from.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0;">So the other candidate was the one we focused one. This was Dennis Murphy and his wife Margaret. He was much more eligible age-wise, and
         could easily have been Eliza's brother. That would make his daughters Mary and Sarah cousins of Joseph Burgin. And his census returns were
         full of fascinating detail which would mean it wouldn't be too hard to track down his origins. I have glued together three of his returns
         here, covering two decades from 1871 to 1891.</p>

      <p>There are quite a few useful facts in these three census records. Dennis Murphy senior was born in Bandon, Cork only a few years either
         way of 1826. Dennis Murphy junior was born around 1867 in Bengal, maybe near Lucknow, in what is now Bangladesh. This means that Dennis senior
         took the Queen's shilling and joined the British Army in the late 1850s or early 1860s. Many Irishmen decided to do this and then went out for
         some years to help police the British Empire. One attractive feature of the arrangement was that you could take your wife and family with you.</p>

      <p>It was easy to establish from the civil records of the births of Margaret's children in Salford that her maiden name was Kennedy.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0">The likelihood was that Dennis had been recruited into the British Army in Ireland, in time for him and Margaret to get to
         Bengal and have Dennis junior in about 1867. Based on this assumption, we were able to identify a marriage of a Margaret Kennedy and a Dennis
         Murphy at St Paul's, Dublin on 13 July 1863. He was living at Royal Barracks, and she was living at 7 Temple St.</p>

      <p>Denis' father was another Denis, and his place of residence looks very like Bandon. Margaret's father was Edward, but his place of residence is almost
         illegible - I've not been able to find anywhere in Tipperary with a name which even vaguely matches. Royal Barracks, Dublin became Collins Barracks at
         independence in 1922, and now houses one of Ireland's national museums. Prior to independence, it had housed many and various units of the British Army
         over very many years, and from late 1862 to summer 1863, it housed the 36th (Herefordshire) Foot Regiment (as it was then).</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0;">Wikipedia and the regimental history websites tell us that 36th Foot received orders for Bengal in June 1863, so Dennis and Margaret must have
         married in the full knowledge of the international adventure to come. They were shipped out of Queenstown in three vessels during August, and
         arrived severally in Calcutta (Kolkat) in November and December. They went on to Lucknow arriving in January 1864, but there was a cholera epidemic,
         and this led to a decision to split up the company. One part went to Moradabad and another to Shahjehanpore. Unfortunately, cholera also struck both
         these places in 1867, but we've already seen that the Murphys must have escaped.</p>

      <p>On 23 September 1867, a record of Dennis Murphy junior's baptism was taken down in the Catholic Church in a place called Meerut. He had been
         born on 12 September to Margaret and Dennis (senior). The record shows that Dennis (senior) was a Private in the 36th and that his place of
         residence was Moradabad.</p>

      <p>While this is all very interesting (to me at least), and gloriously well-evidenced, does it actually get us anywhere in establishing a link
         between Jospeph Burgin's mother Eliza and the godmothers of his children, Mary and Sarah Murphy? The short and disappointing answer is probably not.
         It is very difficult to establish any relationship except marriage and parentage from the records left by the Catholic parishes in Ireland. For
         siblingship, very often all that can be done is a one-by-one comparison of all possible combinations of pairs of baptisms from two separate lists.
         In the current case, I've searched for an Eliza Murphy born to a Dennis around 1819, and a Dennis born to a Dennis around 1826 in or near
         Bandon, Cork. There were two candidates for Eliza, one baptised in county Wexford, mother Mary Carty, and one in St Mary's church Dublin, mother Mary
         (no maiden name given). Restricting the other search to County Cork, there was a Dennis Murphy baptised on 23 September 1838 by a Dennis and Mary
         (maiden name Lehane) in Desertserges, an adjacent parish to Bandon.</p>

      <p>And that is it. I have clearly not come anywhere near showing there was a familial link between Eliza Murphy and Dennis Murphy. On the other
         hand, I have not shown that there was none. Facing up to the full facts, we don't even know whether the Mary and Sarah Murphy we started with
         were the godparents in question. But I hope you've enjoyed the digression.</p>

      <p>Kyran Malone married Christina Sunderland sometime in 1876 in the civil registration district of Athy about 40 miles south-west of Dublin City.
         I am not sure about the civil district, but the RC parish of Athy lay mostly in southern Kildare, with the southern tip protruding over the border
         into Laois (Queen's) - apparently, the chapel in which the marriage took place was on the Kildare side, where the town is situated.
         The whole parish, however, lay within the RC Diocese of Dublin, comprising its south-westerly-most corner. Unusually, we have a civil record of this
         marriage but no church record. If they did have a church wedding in Athy, there seems to be no findable transcription of it - perhaps the original
         records are lost or illegible.</p>

      <p>By some point in 1878, the young couple seem to have been living in Heywood, between Bury and Rochdale in Lancashire, because at the 1881 E&W
         census (by which time they were living in Kearsley (near Farnworth), halfway between Bolton and Salford), there was an Anna Marie recorded as
         age three with birthplace Heywood. She was the first of Kyran and Christina's children, and would later get the nickname Molly.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: -15px;">There are two remarkable aspects of this record. The first is the stunningly poor transcription job: for
         example, Kyran Malone was rendered as Kyves Marland. There is also a little doubt about his daughter's forename: Amy equates with Amelia,
         which converts more readily to Molly than Anny does. But rather strangely I have been unable to identify her, or Samuel's, birth
         registration details with any confidence, whether I searched for Amy or Anny.</p>

      <p style="clear:both;">The second is the presence of many of Christina's close family. I wonder whether they travelled together or followed on.
         Whichever, this is what allowed John Edward Noonan's grandaughter, Mary Clements, to locate this census record despite the efforts of the
         transcriber. Once she knew Christina's maiden name, she was able to search for Sunderland instead of Malone.</p>

      <h4>The Sunderlands and Malones in Ireland</h4>

      <p>Mary Clements managed to trace this branch of the family some way back in Ireland. I am not sure quite how much my discoveries overlap with
         hers, so I'll just present it all as one. Mary obtained the full extract from the Irish civil marriage registry for Kyran and Christina and
         so learned that their fathers had been recorded as Patrick Malone (a farmer) and Samuel Sunderland (a baker). Mary also discovered that
         Samuel had married a Catherine Foster in Athy on 22 November 1851, and (quite unusually for a Catholic marriage in Ireland at that time), there
         is a civil record of that marriage which tells us that both Samuel's and Catherine's fathers were named Robert.</p>

      <p>So the maiden name of Christina's mother, Catherine Sunderland, who appeared in the Kearsley 1881 census, was Foster. We should be able to
         find at least three catholic Sunderland baptisms in the Irish records, quite possibly in Athy: Christina around 1854, William around 1859 and Mary
         around 1870. I scored two out of three, in Athy as expected: Christina Mary Sunderland was born on Christmas day 1852, and <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                                          title = "view Christina's original baptism record"

         was born on 12 August 1868 and <span class = "linkA"

         eventually married in Athy in 1876, this almost certainly gives a quarter century of continuous Sunderland habitation of Athy running from 1851
         at the latest to at least 1876.  In Mary's case, the transcribers of the original documents have once again caused vexation by entering a maiden
         name of Hynes (which appears elsewhere on the original page).</p>
      <br>
      <u>The Sunderlands' provenance</u>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">In searching for a record of Samuel Sunderland's birth, it does not seem unreasonable to assume that a man who married
         in 1851 and was still generating children in 1868 was likely to have been born between 1795 and 1835. But none of the Irish sources of records of
         birth contain any such Samuel Sunderland (or even an S Sunderland), with or without a reasonable mix of spelling variants of the surname, and even
         without a requirement that his father's name should be Robert. Dropping the surname and searching simply for a Samuel born to a Robert in
         Ireland during the same period throws up only 46 results, many of them Catholics. Of the balance, most are Quakers (who seem to have been quite
         strong in Ireland) with a smattering of Church of Ireland. But none of their surnames came anywhere close to any approximation to Sunderland.</p>

      <p>Approaching from a slightly different angle, you can search for any occurrence of the surname Sunderland connected with the town/parish of
         Athy in the half-century ending in 1850. Only one comes up, an 1850 property rates valuation, in which a Daniel Sunderland leases and occupies
         a house at 51 Barrack Street, Athy (remember that street name). The records of this lease continue through 1851 and 1852. Prior to 1850,
         Daniel Sunderland appears in a number of other property rates valuations in nearby towns in Kildare and before that (going back to the early
         1840s), in neighbouring Laois. In one of these he is described as a farmer. Attempts to trace Daniel's origins have proved futile, but it
         looks very much as if he was one of the few Irish-born Sunderlands of those years, and had no close or direct links with the other family
         of Sunderlands which seems to have arrived in Athy perhaps a year or two before 1851. There certainly seem to have been no Sunderlands at
         all in Athy before then other than Daniel (who himself appeared only as late as 1850).</p>

      <p>My fingers are still heavily scarred from my last genealogical scalding, caused by the tempting but so often fatal sin of making a deduction
         based on the apparent absence of information where you'd expect to find it. But given the dearth of Sunderlands in Ireland and in Athy, I couldn't
         resist the urge to search for Samuel Sunderland's birth in England. His dad had to be Robert, he had to be non-Catholic (because as we will
         see later, there is a record of his conversion to Catholicism), and I assumed he was born between 1795 and 1835. This gave two baptisms,
         both in Yorkshire and both in 1832. The first was the son of Robert and Betty, baptised into the Church of England on 23 July in Haworth. The
         second was the son of Robert and Mary, born on 11 September 1828 and baptised in the Primitive Methodist chapel in Bradford on 23 December 1832,
         alongside his younger sister Susannah who was born that year. Here is the
         <span class = "linkA"

               onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen108', 1, 5, 2, 2996, 2176, 'Samuel sunderland baptism 1832 Bradford.jpg');">methodist baptism record</span>.
         Given the lateness of Samuel's baptism, it is possible that the family may have been recent converts to Methodism.</p>

      <p>So, if either of these is the correct Samuel Sunderland, which one should we pick? There were two main reasons why I was immediately
         biased in favour of the non-conformist: his family might be more inclined than an Anglican family to cross the water to Ireland driven
         by missionary zeal (and quite possibly a genuine desire to help in the aftermath of the Great Hunger); and a little research shows that
         Athy did have a thriving non-conformist community and chapel in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>

      <p>But there is harder evidence than this, as there are 1841 census records for both of our Samuels. Here's the <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                            title = "view the CoE Samuel's census record"

         transferable to a flour grinding mill, which in turn could lead on to the baking trade - well, I am only trying! Note too that his younger
         sister Susannah, whose baptism is shown together with Samuel's on the 1832 methodist record, also appears on the census record. There is
         another methodist <span class = "linkA"

		 their younger brother William</span>, in 1835. He is given the middle name "Young", which turns out to be the critical clue for
         the identification of Robert and Mary's marriage: Young was Mary's maiden name, and they were married in Bradford on 15 August 1828, less than
         a month before Samuel's birth.	Unfortunately the transcript of the marriage record contains no information on either of the two sets of parents, so
         we can get no further for now. Nevertheless, I shall place Robert and Mary at the top of the Malone family diagram, even if surrounded
         by question marks.</p>

      <p>Switching to the CofE Sunderland family, we can follow that young Samuel from Haworth through the 1851 and 1861 censuses (by which time
         he is married), which means he was not the groom at the 1851 wedding in Athy. Contrastingly, the Methodist Robert and Mary Sunderland and
         their family seem to disappear from the E&W census records completely after 1841, giving their son Samuel plenty of opportunity to get to Athy,
         meet and court Catherine, and complete the Catholic conversion course by November 1851. There is however a <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                          title = "view James' funeral record"
                                                                                                                          onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen114', 1, 5, 2, 3425, 2608, 'James Sunderland death Bowling 1844.jpg');">record of the funeral</span> in
         1844 of their youngest child James, born in 1840, so any migration to Athy took place between 1844 and 1851.</p>

      <p>So my theory is that Robert and Mary's family, having joined the Primitive Methodists in Bradford in 1832, were at some point persuaded
         that it might be a good idea to go and spread their evangelical message within (largely) catholic Ireland, and somehow landed in Athy. If
         this flight of fancy of mine has any basis in fact, there will surely be some scraps (at least) of methodist records in Bradford which would
         confirm it, but meanwhile we will have to rely on the following items of circumstantial evidence from Athy.</p>

      <p>In chronological order, we first have the <span class = "linkA"
                                                         title = "view Samuel's catholic baptism"

		 baptism into Catholicism</span>, which took place in Athy on 9 November 1851, less than a fortnight before his wedding. Perhaps it had been
         a crash course in Catholicism which finished just in time. My reading of the script is
         <span style="font-family: Georgia;  color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i>"Samuel Sunderland. Adult Convert from Protestantism"</i></b></span>,
         but I remain open-minded about the transcription of the final word. It does seem right, however, that to an Irish Catholic priest, any
         Christian who was not a Catholic would be a Protestant by definition. This description would cover the Anglicans, whether of England or
         of Ireland (which had been my first assumption), or equally the Methodists.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0";>Second, on 22 November 1851, we have the Catholic church record of Samuel and Catherine's marriage (rather than the
         civil record). It's challenging to decipher, and this is as far as I can get: <span style="font-family: Georgia;  color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i>"Samuel Sutherland,

      <p>Thirdly, on 4 October 1852, there is a transcription of the civil registration of a marriage in Athy between a William Sunderland
         (father Robert) to Margaret Darcey (born 1826).If this is the William Sunderland born in Bradford in January 1835, at age 17, this seems
         very young to get married, and to a woman apparently nine years his senior. But it appears there was an imperative, as the next document
         in the historical sequence is an Athy baptism record from 26 March 1853. On that same day, but 12 hours apart, two children had been born
         to William and Margaret, namely Margaret at 3am and Patrick at 3pm. There may be have been little choice but to marry for a young boy who
         had been careless and got carried away during the summer of 1852.</p>

		 of William Sunderland and Margaret Darcy</span> of Inchaquire, again in the Narraghmore parish, on 14 May 1854. It states that they
         were previously married by the civil registrar of the Union of Athy.</p>

      <p>None of these items about William give any idea of his age, to support (or contradict) the theory that he is the son of Robert and Mary
         from Bradford. But the next item on an incident in Samuel Sunderland's life in Athy does give <u>his</u> age.</p>

      <p>The item suggests he may - inadvertently or unavoidably - have somehow strayed from the strait and narrow path normally associated with
         a non-conformist upbringing. It is the <span class = "linkA"
                                                      title = "view Samuel's chargesheet"
                                                      onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen111', 1, 6, 2, 3542, 2706, 'Samuel Sunderland assault charge Athy 1858.jpg');">record of a charge brought against
		 him</span> for a crime allegedly committed on 22 November 1858, which happened to be his seventh wedding anniversary (and around the time when
         his son William Sunderland was born). He and a certain Michael Fitzpatrick supposedly hit Comptroller William Heywood over the head with an
         iron bar, on Barrack Street (again!), where William apparently lived. Samuel's age is given as 29, although this should strictly be 30
         if he was the Samuel Sunderland born in Bradford in September 1828, but that's very close.</p>

      <p>The document gives useful physical descriptions of both defendants, and Samuel's profession is stated as "baker". He seems to have spent
         a few nights in the police cells and then to have been bailed until a court appearance in mid-December. Without investigating properly, I have
         glimpsed other documents which suggest that the pair were convicted and served a gaol sentence. This incident raises all manner of questions.
         Whether or not it was related to the position of the victim, the "Comptroller", I have no idea. Did this mean control as in authority, or was
         he some sort of accountant? The word was certainly used to describe a certain class of customs official, so perhaps there was an issue related
         to taxes or goods. Why do we keep on finding apparently unconnected references to Barrack Street - is there some link to the Daniel Sunderland
         who apparently lived there in the early 1850s? Did the pair visit Mr Heywood's street intending assault, or did a doorstep dispute get out of hand? If
         the crime was un-premeditated, did there happen to be an iron bar conveniently to hand?  It does rather sound like the culmination of a grievance,
         however disproportionate the reaction, and we are surely hearing only one side of a complex story here.</p>

      <p>The final Samuel Sunderland record is the registration of his death, in Athy, in 1869 (not long after the last child Mary
         Sunderland was born). The age at death is recorded as 40, which would be consistent with that of the Bradford Samuel Sunderland if he
         died before 11 September. As the death was registered with the civil authorities, the Irish Registrar should be able to supply a full
         extract from the Register.</p>

      <p>But what of Robert, Mary and Susannah Sunderland, if they left Bradford for Athy "en famille" in the late 1840s? Although it is clear
         from interrogating the Athy records that a mini-Sunderland clan was accumulating in and around Athy in the latter half of the nineteenth
         century, I can find no trace of these three, either in Yorkshire or Ireland, unless you allow Robert to have a mid-life crisis in 1864,
         and/or to lose his wife Mary before 1867 and re-marry in that year. Since Robert had married Mary in 1828, he was probably born just after
         the turn of the century, so perhaps - as I would like to think - we're looking at a completely different and much younger Robert Sunderland
         here. Because it is difficult to a imagine a man of about 60, a methodist to boot, being convicted of fishing in someone else's waters and
         on-street gaming and gambling, as some Robert Sunderland was in 1864. I remain open-minded about the 1867 marriage: interestingly, the
         record is of a civil registration, not a catholic ceremony, which would be expected if, unlike his two sons, he had never been "Received
         into the Church", conditionally or not.</p>

      <p>Here we must leave the Athy Sunderlands. Do you believe that Samuel and William were the sons of Robert and Mary from Bradford? I
         think I do.</p>
      <br>
      <u>The Fosters' background</u>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">Taking a similar approach as with Samuel, I searched Irish Catholic baptisms from 1795 to 1835 for a Catherine, daughter
         of a Robert Foster. There was a single baptism that met these conditions, on 28 June 1825 in Dundalk, County Louth. The mother was a Mary Casidy.
         That is what the transcription says. But if you look carefully at the <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                     title = "view Dundalk 1825 Foster baptism"
                                                                                     onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen118', 1, 6, 2, 2827, 3615, 'Catherine Foster baptism 1825.jpg');">original document</span>, I think
         you will agree that it was not a Catherine that was baptised that day, but a William! So I've treated this as a red herring.</p>

      <p>Taking an alternative approach, I searched for any baptisms in County Kildare with father Robert Foster from 1800 to 1840. This produced a
         John (1824), Michael (1826), Robert (1830), Susan (1832), another Robert (1836) and a George (1840), all baptised in Athy. In John's case the
         mother was named as Catherine Ratigan, in Michael's as Bridget Foster, and in the other four as Bridget Ratigan. For John, I think the priest
         got muddled with the name of one of the sponsors (Catherine), and for Michael he simply used the married name (as in myriads of other baptisms).</p>

      <p>At the 1881 census in Kearsley Lancashire, Catherine Foster's age was recorded as 59, so she could well have been baptised in the latter part
         of 1822. The catholic parish of Athy record of baptisms for 1822 is largely illegible, most of the writing having faded to almost nothing (some
         originally in pencil, possibly). I think Catherine was the first of seven children born to Robert Foster and Bridget Ratigan in Athy from 1822 to
         1840. Or at least that is the best I can do for now - Robert Foster and and Bridget Ratigan of Athy will come high on the Malone family diagram,
         albeit beset by question marks as usual.</p>
      <br>
      <u>The Malones' pedigree</u>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">There are three slightly inconsistent sources from which we might deduce Kyran Malone's date of birth (or at least an approximation). He said he
         was 32 at the 1881 census (so born between April 1848 and March 1849) and 40 at the 1891 census (implying April 1850 to March 1851). At his death
         in the fourth quarter of 1900, his age was recorded as 49 (implying Oct 1850 to Dec 1851). In any event, Kyran is not a particularly common name,
         so I did a pan-Ireland search for Kyran Malone baptisms between 1845 and 1855. Only two came up, both in the diocese of Ossory, one in the parish
         of Aghaboe in County Laois and the other in the parish of Johnstown in County Kilkenny. The Aghaboe Kyran was baptised on 29 August 1849, and
         the other on 17 October 1847. These dates are fairly reliable, as the records were kept on sequential pages in sequential books.</p>

      <p>Both locations and dates are entirely plausible for a young man to get to the town of Athy by 1876 and meet, woo and wed Christina Sunderland.
         The problem is that the good year of birth (1849 in Aghaboe) turns out to be associated with the wrong father's name, James. Whereas the father's
         name in the 1847 Johnstown baptism is Patrick as required, but the 1847 date is somewhat early. I would tend to plump for the name over the year,
         but it's quite possible that neither of them is correct, as the correct baptism record might be lost or have become so garbled as to be unfindable by
         means of a digital search. Even a variant of the search, omitting surnames, for any Kyran born to a Patrick doesn't reveal any obvious
         alternative possibilities. So I'll run with Patrick Malone and Anne Cody and an 1847 birth in Johnstown Kilkenny. In this instance, the question
         marks will have to be in crimson, because there are no linking factors whatsoever. I even checked the property valuations of the 1840s in the
         hope that a farmer would hold a lease over some land. But there were so many Patrick Malones in that category dotted all over Ossory that this
         foray led nowhere. It seems that Ossory, straddling south Laois and north Kilkenny, may have been the original homeland of the Malones.</p>

      <p>Our Johnstown Kyran appears to have been the second of three children born to Patrick Malone and Anne Cody: Nancy in 1843, Kyran in 1847 and
         John in 1856 (by which time they had moved northwards into the parish of Rathdowney adjacent to Aghaboe in Laois). In Rathdowney, they were
         slightly closer to Kyran's marital destination of Athy than they had been in Johnstown.</p>

      <h4>The Malones in Salford</h4>

      <p>By census day 1891, the Malones were living at 3 Sagar Street, just on the Lower Broughton side of the river, so not quite in Salford technically.
         Working backwards from the ages and places of birth of their children, they had moved some time between 1885 and 1890.</p>

         registration records) less two infant deaths. There are baptism records from St John the Evangelist for the Salford-born children, including
         three more who came after John Francis during the 1890s. There had also been four subtractions: the three Sunderlands had disappeared and Anny Marie
         was no longer present. I have been unable to trace the fate of William or Mary - just possibly, they returned to Ireland. But there was a death

      <p>If our Catherine did in fact die in Bolton between July and September 1890, the move to Salford must have been very soon after, as John Francis

      <p style="margin-top:-5px;">Kyran Malone died in the fourth quarter of 1900, the death being recorded in Chorlton (inner south Manchester to us)
         rather than Salford. Perhaps he died in a hospital, or suddenly a little distance from home. He left seven children who had survived infancy out
         of the eleven to which Christina had given birth. Quite an accomplishment. At the 1901 census, just a few months after his death, all seven were
         gathered under the roof of their widowed mother's house at 92 Sussex Street, Lower Broughton. So here were seven offspring, five of whom were of
         marriageable age, and the other two fast approaching.</p>

      <p>What happened next is exactly what you would expect, namely a sequence of marriages. It began in 1902 and ended in 1922, by which time there were
         no unmarried offspring remaining. If you've read in order, you'll know from Chapter 2 that we've already looked at the early days of the first
         five of the seven families that grew from these marriages, all living cheek-by-jowl in the "Malone Quarter" of Lower Broughton in 1911. For
         Theresa Malone and John Noonan, we were able to fast forward to 1939 and find their whole family in the national Register compiled that September.
         It turns that we can do the same with all six of the other Malone branches, although in many cases we find only the residue of the family, due
         to children leaving home and deaths. So let's look backwards at the six families through the prism of the household information collected for
         the 1939 Register.

      <p>I haven't investigated the children produced by these six families in any depth - I may have missed some, or there may have
         been early deaths. In some cases, where a daughter is still present in the household in the 1939 Register (which gives clues on future marriages),
         I've followed up those clues.</p>

      <p>Starting with the oldest, Anna Malone married Richard Kavanagh in 1902, but by the outset of WWII she was a widow. <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                                  title = "view the Kavanagh's 1939 record"
                                                                                                                                  onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen123', 1, 5, 2, 3734, 4319, 'Part of Cavanagh family 1939.jpg');">Anna's 1939 Register entry</span> shows
         her living at 22 Stancliffe Road (maybe in Wythenshawe) with her third child Richard, his wife Katheen (nee Matthews, a 1931 marriage),
         and their daughter Sheila born in 1936. The entry tells us that Sheila will marry into the Baguley family, and the civil register of marriages
         confirms that she duly married a Philip Baguley, in Manchester in 1960. There is an issue with Anna Kavanagh's date of birth, given as 7 December
         1879. She was recorded as age three at the 1881 census, and if this was 3 completed years, she had to be born before the end of March 1878. Even
         if she hadn't quite reached her third birthday, her parents are hardly likely to get her so inaccurate. What's more, her younger brother Samuel
         was recorded as age one in 1881, which means he was born before April 1880, biologically impossible relying on the 1939 record. Perhaps the correct
         date of birth is 7 December 1877.</p>

      <p>Anna and Richard (senior) registered the births of five children in Salford from 1904 to 1917. There were three more births registered in the
         names of Kavanagh/Malone in the Barton registration district from 1920 to 1924. Even though I cannot find a separate marriage to which these "belong",
         I somehow doubt that they were Anna and Richard's.</p>

      <p>Next, Samuel Malone married Ada Mary Burns in 1906, but Ada was also a widow by the start of WWII. <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                  title = "view Ada Malone's 1939 record"
                                                                                                                  onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen124', 1, 5, 2, 2946, 2653, 'Ada and Dorothy Malone 1939.jpg');">Ada's 1939 Register entry</span> shows her
         living with Dorothy Malone at 3 Winster Avenue. This was within the estate on the opposite side of Littleton Road from No. 309 where
         Richard and Kate Noonan and family lived. Dorothy Malone (nee Wright) had married Samuel and Ada's first-born, Samuel (junior) in 1935.
         We can only speculate as to where Samuel (senior) was based at the time the Register was taken, but people were already being moved
         around on account of the war. The birth of Samuel (junior) had been registered in 1907, and a baby sister Norah was registered in 1911.
         Dad wrote in Down the Arches that Sam (junior) had worked in a chip shop almost next door to 309 in the 1930s, and surely Sam's mother
         Ada was the person who picked up dad's brother John's body after he was knocked down in 1932.</p>

      <p>A few doors down from Ada and Dorothy at 9 Winster Avenue was Kyran and Phyllis Lawler's household. Kyran was a bus conductor, so from his
         profession and his forename, it is easy to work out his family provenance. He was the son of Margaret Malone and Francis Lawler, and he seems
         to have been an only-child. Kyran had married Phyllis Pattinson in 1937, and they registered the birth of David K Lawler in the Barton district
         in 1938 - he must be the blocked record in the Register. As it happened, in 1939 Margaret and Francis lived on the same street at No. 35,
         whence (<span class = "linkA"
                       title = "view the Lawlers' and Corcorans' 1939 records"
                       onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen125', 1, 5, 2, 3689, 2093, 'Lawlers and Corcorans 1939.jpg');">their 1939 Register record</span> shows),
         Francis juggled his responsibilities as Billiard Hall Manager and Air Raid Warden. They had been married in 1908 and Kyran's (aka Keyran) birth
         was registered in 1910. The date of birth given for Margaret Lawler (October 27 1883) is surely wrong, as her birth was registered in the first
         quarter of 1883. Perhaps it was October 27 1882.</p>

      <p>The tally of Malone households based in Winster Avenue in 1939 is not yet complete. The Corcorans lived next door to the Lawlers at No. 37.
         Joseph Corcoran had married Winifred Malone (Christina's youngest daughter surviving to adulthood) in 1922. It seems they never had any
         children.</p>

      <p>Henry McGuinness had married Agnes Malone in 1907, and both survived to appear in the 1939 Register. <span class = "linkA"
                                                                                                                    title = "view the McGuinness' 1939 record"
                                                                                                                    onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen126', 1, 5, 2, 3703, 3282, 'Henry Mcguiness 1939.jpg');">Their record</span> shows them living at 15
         Murray St, off the west side of Bury New Road, towards Higher Broughton. Five births were registered in their names in Salford from 1909 to
         1918 and two of them, Mary (b. 1913) and Bernard (b. 1917) were still single and living with them in 1939. Henry was still "with the Corporation",
         but he was now a car cleaner instead of a conductor. He was also an ex-soldier, but I haven't found any military records. Bernard was a
         railway signalman and Mary was a stitcher in the textile industry. In 1941, she would marry a Bernard O'Rourke in Salford.</p>

      <p>Finally, there was Kyran and Christina Malone's youngest, Joseph K Malone. He married Charlotte Johnson in 1921, and they both survived
         to be recorded in the 1939 Register. <span class = "linkA"
                                                    title = "view Joseph and Charlotte's 1939 record"

         Broughton, parallel to and just to the west of the Irwell. They registered the birth of their son, Austin J Malone, in 1922, and it looks
         like he was an only-child. His must be the blanked out record in the 1939 Register. Once again, their is a date of birth problem. Joseph
         was born on 21 January 1896, not 1895, as all other documentation confirms.</p>

      <p>So there are the Malones, from 1901 to 1939. In 1901, all seven lived under the widow Christina's roof at 92 Sussex Street, lower Broughton.
         By 1911, five had set up separate households, but they were all within a tightly-packed little area within Lower Broughton. By 1939, they had
         spread out slightly but five of the seven were living within a few minutes walk from Littleton Road, the McGuinnesses were only a little way
         further north up Bury New Road, and only the eldest Anna Kavanagh lived at any distance (if she was indeed in Wythenshawe), at an address almost
         certainly chosen by her son and daughter-in-law.</p>

         But the record, once found, was invaluable. The ages and birthplaces of the children show us that the
         family had probably relocated from Dublin to Salford between about 1853 and 1857. It leads to Eliza's baptism record at St John the Evangelist,
         which in turn gives us Ramsbottom, Margaret's maiden name.</p>

      <p>We can then identify a string of baptisms in Dublin, and Patrick and Margaret's marriage in 1838 in the parish of Stradbally in Laois (Queen's).
         Let's look at the baptisms first, all except one of which specify Patrick Corcoran as the father and Margaret Ramsbottom as mother. The exception
         was Henry's baptism, for which the mother was recorded as Mary Ramsbottom.</p>

      <p>Comparing the baptism list with the 1861 census entries, there are one or two obvious anomalies. We will see later that Honoria went through
         many "name changes" during her life, so we can immediately equate Honoria with Anny. If we assume that the Dublin baptisms followed soon after
         the births, it is clear that, except in Mary's case, the given ages (at the previous birthday) are given very nearly perfectly at the 1861 census
         (although in Edward's case, we need to assume he was baptised on his birthday, as the twelfth anniversary of this fell on the day after 1861 census
         day). Even where parents give inaccurate ages for their children, they rarely get the birth-order wrong, and in all the E&W census returns I have
         seen, the enumerators have listed children in birth-order.</p>

      <p>So there is a major anomaly around Mary Corcoran's birthdate and age. Her recorded ages at the subsequent three censuses from 1871 to 1891 are
         reasonably consistent with a year of birth of about 1853, as is the age recorded at her death in 1894. The Mary baptised in Dublin in 1847 simply
         cannot be our great-grandmother - this would require Patrick and Margaret to shift the seniority order so that a sister two years older than Edward
         became three years younger.</p>

      <p>The records of deaths in early to mid-nineteenth century Ireland - or at least those digitised and accessible on-line - are massively deficient.
         Part of the reason for this, of course, is that during and following on from the Great Hunger, there were so many deaths, and so little in the way
         of apparatus for dealing with them, let alone documenting them. As Thomas Corcoran is not living with his parents in Salford in early April 1861, he
         has either died or gone his separate way. If his parents left Dublin around 1855, he would only have been about ten, so probably hadn't "gone his
         own way" by then. But he might easily have died as a youngster in Dublin. If he did cross the water with his parents, he could have died en route,
         and there were quite a few Thomas Corcorans recorded as dying in Liverpool in the mid-1850s, although none of them gave any indication of age.
         There are no deaths in the Salford area which give an obvious match.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, Thomas may have flown the nest after arriving in Salford, but if so we would hope to find him in another household in Salford or
         Manchester at the 1861 census, which we don't. Nor do we see him appear at any subsequent Corcoran family events such as the marriages of his
         sisters or the baptisms of their children. I think he probably died young, and the greatest risks would have been in the Dublin of the late 1840s,
         or maybe passing through Liverpool if they had to stop over for any length of time.</p>

      <p>The story around Mary Corcoran must be slightly different. Enormous efforts have been made to locate our great-grandmother's (1853ish) baptism
         record, whether it took place in Ireland or England (because she could have left Ireland before being baptised), all to no avail. But the very fact
         that she was named "Mary" tells us that her older sister Mary had died before she was born. So the 1847 Mary must have died in Dublin, probably as an
         infant. 1847 must have been one the worst possible years to be born in Dublin, because the city was by then filling up rapidly with starving,
         impoverished and diseased refugees from the countryside. Our great-grandmother Mary was later born in Dublin, probably some time from April
         1852 to March 1853, before the family emigrated to England in the mid-1850s. The large gap between Edward and Eliza's births also supports
         this theory.</p>

      <h4>Patrick and Margaret's origins</h4>

      <p>At the 1861 E&W census, Patrick and Margaret very thoughtfully left a marker that they had both been born in Laois (aka Queen's County). The
         ages they gave at the census look as if there was some deliberate rounding, suggesting that they weren't entirely sure of their exact year
         of birth. But they clearly knew that Patrick was significantly older. Taking the given age of 40 literally, she would have been born between April
         1820 and March 1821. This would mean she married at age 17 or 18, had her first child at about age 20 and her last at age 36. All this seems
         perfectly plausible. There are two later censuses suggesting she was around five years older, but that timeline would also stand up. Perhaps a
         doubtful 44 got rounded down to 40 at the 1861 census. Other than the 1861 census, there is no other evidence on Patrick's age, so we must
         take 1810-11 to be the central estimate.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:-10px;">Patrick and Margaret's marriage record tells us very little, not even the names of any of their
         parents. They were married in Stradbally Catholic parish, Laois, on 2 July 1838, and the witnesses were James Foy and Judith Byrne. The
         page contains a column headed "Place", and for Patrick and Margaret this was recorded as Celbridge, County Dublin. Strictly speaking, the
         Catholic parish of Celbridge lies just outside County Dublin in Kildare (although it is well within the Catholic diocese of Dublin). But
         perhaps the 1838 boundaries were different. The significance of this is not entirely clear, as they both seem to have been born in or near
         Stradbally, although their first child Henry was baptised in central Dublin two years later. Perhaps the pair had met near Dublin and
         returned for a family wedding. Or perhaps Patrick had gone ahead to set up a bridal home near Dublin.</p>
      <br>
      <u>The Ramsbottoms</u>
      <p style="margin-top:0;">Focusing first on the Ramsbottoms, my immediate reaction was that Margaret's maiden name was English not Irish. Yet
         it's clear from the digital records that were small pockets	of Ramsbottoms dotted around Ireland going back as far as the mid-17th century,
         including at least one in Laois in the 1740s. Maybe one or two arrived with Oliver's army and never left! It certainly doesn't sound like
         a name that filtered down from the descendants of the Norman/Anglo-Irish barons, who would have been Catholic until the English reformation
         and then divided in a proportion unknown to me.</p>

      <p>What can be seen clearly is that, starting roughly from the 1790s, a small clan of Ramsbottoms started to accumulate in south-eastern Laois
         and adjacent parts of some of the neighbouring counties such as Kildare, Carlow and Kilkenny.  Whether or not they had ever been Puritans, Quakers,
         Methodists or any other flavour of Protestant I do not know. But if so, they seem to have long since been assimilated into the local Catholic
         culture. All the Ramsbottoms baptisms and marriages I have seen in the area have been Catholic, and there has not been so much as a whisper of
         a passion-driven conversion to the faith.</p>

      <p>During the search for Margaret's parents, I came across two interesting early Ramsbottoms in Ireland, although they tell us little or
         nothing of the means by which the Ramsbottom genes might have transferred across the Irish Sea. Henry seems to have been a very popular boy's
         name amongst the Ramsbottoms, and there is a reference to an event involving one such in the County Laois Quaker Congregational records for 1747.
         Apparently, the Society of Friends in Ireland had been founded only two years after the English Society, about one hundred years previously, and
         it quickly spread to have a nationwide presence in Ireland.</p>

      <p>Students of Irish history will know of the hated tax imposed by the British Crown (in its role as head of the established church) in the
         form of a tithe extracted from church members of all denominations. I'm not sure whether Church of Ireland members themselves were
         required to pay it, but most of them probably suported it anyway  - in fact, they quite possibly controlled a large proportion of
         the proceeds of the tax. Although the tithe was aimed at members of the Catholic Church, it was also imposed on the Quakers. Being Quakers, though,
         they didn't take up arms to fight the exploitative authoriities, but instead vented their anger and resentment by meticulously documenting
         every last farthings-worth of value extracted from them (mostly in beautiful handwriting).</p>

      <p style="margin-top:-5px;">The record I found for Henry Ramsbottom, somewhere in Laois in 1747, is a detailed list of exactly what was taken by the tithe-takers from each
         member of the local Society of Friends. But if I read the record correctly, Henry was not one of the Quakers, rather he was amongst the (no doubt
         highly unpopular) team of tithe-takers extracting the tax. Unless I misunderstand, this means he was highly unlikely to be associated with any church
         except the established Church of Ireland. And this in turn implies, I think, that either Henry or his forefathers had at some stage in the previous
         hundred years or so, migrated from England to Ireland.</p>

      <p>My best reading is as follows: <span style="font-family: Georgia;  color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i>Joshua Thompson had taken from him for Tithe by
	William Nowlands & Associates, Servants to William Dawson, Priest of the Parish of Dysarts Galin, 5 Fleeces of Wool, 2 Lambs & 6 Carlo. of Hay worth
	£1 12s. And by Henry Ramsbottom & Associates, Tithe-taker understudy Priest, 2 Ridges of Potatoes & 80lbs of small Barley worth 19s 6d - All
	worth £2 11s 6d.</i></b></span></p>

      <p>All that amounts to quite a tidy annual haul from a single member of a single church, remembering that the non-Church of Ireland were in most
         places a massive majority.</p>

      <p>The "priests" and "under-priests" were what we would call vicars of the Church of Ireland. Dysartsgalen, as it is now called, is a parish of
         that church, often called a civil parish. It is in the Catholic parish of Abbeyleix, which is next to Stradbally. The centres of Abbeyleix and
         Stradbally are only about 10 miles apart, and Athy, where the Malones and Sunderlands came from, is only a little further from Abbeyleix, across
         the border in Kildare.</p>

      <p>If Henry Ramsbottom of the civil parish of Dysartgalen, the under-tithe-taker of 1747, was a Protestant, his probable descendants were certainly
         not. The next occurrence of the Ramsbottom name in the County Laois records which I can access was at a baptism nearly 50 years later in 1796
         in the parish of Ballynakill (adjacent to the parishes of Abbeyleix and of Stradbally, all three Catholic). An Elizabeth Ramsbottom
         was christened a catholic there by her parents George Ramsbottom and Anne Conrahy. But before following that line any further down the arches, it
         might be interesting to look at another Ramsbottom who passed through the adjacent county of Kilkenny a few years later in 1814.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:-5px;">Bridget’s fellow-lodger, Bridget Making, was roughly her age and in the same trade. The bride's marriage
         witness was recorded as a Bridget Caffrey of Harriet Street. We could find no Bridget Caffrey at all in the 1851 census of Harriet St or anywhere
         nearby, so maybe the witness was Bridget Making, and there was some kind of error in recording or transcribing the wedding records. Or maybe Ms
         Making married a Mr Caffrey between March and September, although we can find no evidence of this.</p>

      <p>I had been hoping that the identities and histories of Bridget O’Neill's fellow-lodgers or wedding witness might throw up some evidence or clue
         as to her origins in Ireland. But no, at least not so far. The ages given in the four censuses from 1851-1881 are 23, 36, 44 and 50, placing
         her birth year anywhere between 1824 and 1831. It is entirely possible that she didn’t know her own year of birth, in the form of a number. Her
         surname is one of the very many available variant English spellings of O’Neill, which itself is surely a translation from Gaelic. In what follows,
         I’ve mostly used the spellings as found in the original documents – the variations only occasionally give pause for doubt. But - from the
         marriage record - we know Bridget’s parents’ Christian names were John and Sarah (and that, in September 1951, she believed them to be dead).
         Also, it is difficult to see why her birthplace should be explicitly specified as County Dublin in the 1871 census if that was not true, whatever
         might have been recorded at the other censuses.</p>

      <p>The digitised transcriptions of the hundreds of years of Catholic parish baptisms in Ireland inevitably fall well short of capturing every
         baptism, and are sure to be inaccurate in places, if only because of the multiple difficulties of interpretation of age-old handwritten scripts.
         But if you search for the baptism of a Bridget born to a John and Sarah in County Dublin between 1821 and 1831, there are only five results of
         which one is a Bridget Neil. This baptism took place on 6 March 1825 in Balbriggan, a small seaside town (and Parish, and Townland) about 20
         miles north of Dublin. Her parents were John Neil and Sarah Halpenny. Whilst there is no proof that this is the Bridget O’Neill who married
         John Noonan in Salford in 1851, I think the probability looks pretty high. In this case, we have both a <span

      <p>I have also identified John O'Neill's and Sarah Halpenny's marriage in Balbriggan, which oddly took place after Bridget's baptism, on 28 August 1825.
         From my Irish searches, it is surprising that we don't find the standard abbreviation for the Latin<span style="font-family: Georgia;
	color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i> "Filia Illegitima"</i></b></span> scrawled heavily by the priest in the baptism book. But no, the policy in
         Balbriggan seems to have been more tolerant - perhaps he simply said kindly to the young couple "<i>come back to get married just as soon as
            you have saved up the fee</i>". Here is the

      <p>Happily there was a <span style="font-family: Georgia; color: DarkSlateGrey;"><b><i> "Filium Legitimum"</i></b></span> to follow some time
         after John and Sarah married, in the form of Francis O'Neill, Bridget's younger brother, who was baptised on 10 September 1826. Here is the

         witnesses/godparents seem to be Thomas Neal and Cath Reilly, or something similar. I was hoping that I might find Francis later in
         his life, perhaps even in England if he migrated there too, and thus provide some supporting evidence that we have the correct Bridget
         O'Neill. But no luck so far, as Francis simply disappears - he may not even have survived infancy.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:0;">Unfortunately, John and Sara's marriage record provides no information on parentage, and I cannot trace Sara Halpenny’s
         birth or baptism, despite searching the whole British Isles, and despite the fact that there seems to have been at least
         one generation of Halfpennys going back from 1825 in Balbriggan. But if we search for births/baptisms of John O'Neills focusing solely on
         Balbriggan, the only candidate of a suitable age is the child of Felix O’Neill and Rose Rann, who was baptised on 20 December 1805.
         They had been married (<span
                 class="linkA"
                 title = "View 1989 transcript"
                 onclick="bigimg('fullscreen53', 1, 5, 2, 2477, 3476, 'Felix ONeal Rose Rann marriage 1799 Balbriggan(1).jpg');">see transcript</span>) on
         4 February 1799 (witnesses Patrick Rann and Hugh Connell), and had Elenor in 1800, Patrick in 1802, John in 1805 (<span
                 class="linkA"
                 title = "View original image"
                 onclick="bigimg('fullscreen54', 1, 5, 2, 4748, 2832, 'John ONeill baptism 1805 Balbriggan(1).jpg');">see original page</span>) and
         finally another Felix in 1807. This is the furthest back we’ve reached, and is all based on the assumptions that the Balbriggan Bridget
         O’Neil is the correct one, and that her father was also born there.</p>

      <p>This has allowed us to construct a small and tentative family diagram for Bridget O'Neill. It doesn't mean much by itself, but it might
         justify a research trip to Balbriggan. Heaven knows how much or how little might be discoverable - it
         is difficult to imagine that a trace might remain of a young woman who emigrated before 1851, probably in the midst of the 1846-1850 chaos.</p>
      <br>
      <img src = "Balbriggan business directory 1846.jpg"
           style ="width: 500px; border: 2px solid sienna;float: right;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left:20px; margin-top:6px;"
           class = "linkC"
           title = "view flexible image"
           onclick = "bigimg('fullscreen56', 1, 5, 2, 1655, 1949, 'Balbriggan business directory 1846.jpg');">

      <p style="margin-top:0;">But there are some faint trails of circumstantial evidence. In the 1846 trade directory for Balbriggan, a John O'Neill had a carpentry
         business on Hampton Street. There was no similar listing in 1848. Balbriggan was quite big on cotton weaving, and associated textile
         industries, I think both mechanised and traditional. It was a place where Bridget O'Neill could have learned the skills on which she relied
         in Stockport. It was a port town, and Liverpool was the main overseas destination for its merchant ships. So Bridget could easily have
         arranged passage to Liverpool. But it was also linked by railway to nearby Dublin, offering an alternative route.</p>

      <p>For various reasons,the Fingal area (containing Balbriggan) was hard hit by the 1846-1850 crisis. The crop failure in 1846 was total.
         One the major Dublin workhouses was located at nearby Balrothery, and these places became centres of disease. The local powers enforced the
         cruel and perverse decrees from London strictly. Many local smallholders lost their properties entirely, as larger landowners took advantage
         of the opportunity to expand and consolidate. There were epidemics of typhoid in 1846 and cholera in 1849. The smallholding farming industry
         must have collapsed completely, with severe knock-on effects on local small businesses. It would be all too easy to succumb to any of these
         threats, and if young Bridget lost her parents in their forties in the midst of all this, it would not be at all surprising. Perhaps
         they gave her their last cash towards her travels.</p>

      <p>But where did John Noonan come into all this? Once he was settled in Pendleton and she in Stockport, they would be unlikely to meet. And
         how and why did she head for Stockport and he for Salford? My theory is that they met during the escape journey. It is just possible that
         he travelled through Balbriggan to avoid the worst that Dublin City could throw at him (which would have been very bad). Or she travelled
         via Dublin and they met there. More likely, I think, is that they met in Liverpool, by which time he had some kind of destination point
         in Salford and she in Stockport. So they each stuck to their individual plan, but agreed to wed as soon as they could.</p>

      <p>All that can be said of this flight of fancy, though, is that to me it is the most plausibly consistent with the few known facts! But on
         reflection, John and Bridget's marriage certificate might (just possibly) show the places of residence and/or occupations of the fathers of
         the happy couple which could (just possibly) establish some link to Balbriggan, at least. Perhaps it should be added to the shopping list.</p>
