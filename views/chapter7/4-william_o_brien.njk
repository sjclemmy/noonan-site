<h4>William O'Brien</h4>

<p>The final record that I have found from Tipperary which might represent a scrap of our Noonan family history is
of a political nature. The record is part of the William Smith O'Brien petition of 1848, which was made 
in response to him being convicted for treason and sentenced to death. The "crime" was related to his 
involvement the Battle of Widow McCormackâ€™s Cabbage Patch on 29 July 1848.</p>

<p>When I originally discovered this, I had very little idea of what it had all been about. I did a lot 
of shallow, off-the-hoof, research, in an effort to provide some context for the genealogical find. Looking
back, I don't suppose I did too badly, but later events showed that I was some way off the mark. </p>

<p>I had a former friend and colleague, Roy Sloan, with whom Angie and I had worked in Mpopoma High School in 
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe in the early 1980s. He was a historian by trade, and (unlike this fifth-generation emigrant)
a true-born Irishman. About the time we were researching all this Noonan history, I was rediscovering 
his acquaintance after around thirty years. It was only very recently that I learned that he had been 
an avid student of Irish political history, that one of his specialist subjects was the politics and 
life of William Smith O'Brien, and that he had published a book on that very theme. There was no way I was 
going to get away with my shallow gloss over the subject any longer!</p>

<p>I had written that the crop failure, the famine, the epidemics, the evictions and the land clearances 
had contributed to the events leading to the Cabbage Patch incident. I had referred contextually to
the turmoil across much of Europe at the time, with peoples wanting to achieve self-determination 
within their specific national groups instead of being ruled by aristocracies often far removed. All
this was true, as far as it went, but it completely missed the long political build-up to the incident.</p>

<p>If you have a deeper interest - or want greater focus on the detail - you should read 
Roy's book: it is a very  clearly-written professional history of a career which ended in tragi-comedy. 
It may be difficult to obtain now, but a good library should be able to locate and order a copy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I offer my ha'penny's worth summary here. Towards the end of the 1840s, it seems O'Brien 
had been effectively leading the Young Irelanders, and I think he must have concluded at some point 
that there was no option left but to organise an armed rebellion, starting with the peasantry. His 
specific problem was that he proved utterly ill-equipped to organise such an uprising. </p> 

<p>One outcome of that strategic decision was that on 29 July 1848, a small group from 
the Young Ireland Movement threatened and then chased an Irish Constabulary unit until it took 
refuge in a house - that of Widow McCormack - in a small village (Ballingarry) in south Tipperary,
 and took hostages there for its own protection.</p>

<p>There was a siege and some shooting and some casualties and deaths, but nothing enormous 
in the context of the situation at the time - I don't think there was a single serious injury or 
death amongst public officials. Official reinforcements eventually arrived and 
the Young Irelanders were forced to flee. On 5 August, O'Brien was arrested as ultimately were all
the leaders of the "uprising". They were eventually put on trial and convicted of treason 
(ie, against the British Crown). On 19 October 1848, O'Brien was sentenced to death by hanging, 
drawing and quartering (although I don't think anyone expected his execution to actually take 
this gruesome mediaeval form).</p>

<p>The link with our ancestors comes via a document dated October 28 1848, and signed by significant
numbers of residents of Carrick-on-Suir and its surrounds. This was the town's petition to the
Governor General (or Lord Lieutenant) of Ireland to exercise clemency in the O'Brien case. 
There was only one Noonan signatory in Carrick, and his forename was John.</p>

<p>Was the John who signed this the same John who married in Salford in 1851, who lost his daughter
days short of age 18, then his 14-year old son to a dyeing machine, and finally died of apoplexy 
just after Christmas 1877, not long after the famous Elkie Armitage had himself died just up 
the road? We don't know. But if it was, he would probably have been between age 16 and 20
at the time. There was no James Noonan recorded amongst the signatories - but he probably
couldn't write his name, and may anyway have already died himself by then. The O'Brien petition 
had over 80,000 signatories, of which over 40,000 were from Dublin, but nearly 10,000 from England. 
It was actually a set of slightly different petitions, because every area chose its
own wording, and it is Carrick's wording which is shown here.</p>

<p>But there were a number of critical points that I had missed entirely in my shallow course of 
reading before I discovered Roy's work. The rapidity of political events through July 1848 was 
astounding. The Lord Lieutenant had "proclaimed" four counties on 18 July, effectively removing
the right of all civilian residents to bear arms in Dublin, Drogheda, Cork and Waterford. On 22
July, the commons in London enacted a suspension of Habeas Corpus across Ireland, giving the 
authorities the power of detention without trial, to last well into 1849. )of the right
that Tipperary was the main theatre of
the rebellion of the Young Irelander's Movement. Nor that the town of Carrick-on-Suir featured quite
strongly in that history. And finally, I didn't know that O'Brien had toured these towns, including
Carrick, in an effort to build up a head of feeling and support amongst the local populations for 
the actions he envisaged.</p>

<p>O'Brien had entered Carrick-on-Suir on 24 July</p>
